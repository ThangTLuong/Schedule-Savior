# Schedule Savior [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Python-blue?logo=python)](https://www.python.org/)

## Aim of the Project
The primary objective of the Schedule Savior project is to create a versatile and efficient solution for schools and educational institutions to manage teacher absences seamlessly. This project is designed to provide a robust tool that, on any given weekday (Monday to Friday), can generate a list of available substitute teachers to cover the entire day's schedule of an absent teacher.

## Basic Structure of the Project
The project's core structure revolves around a well-organized data management system and a user-friendly interface. Here's a breakdown of the essential components:

### 1. JSON Data Storage
The project employs a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file to store comprehensive schedules for all teachers in a school. Each teacher's schedule for the entire week, from Monday to Friday, is meticulously recorded within this JSON file. This data structure allows for flexibility and scalability.

### 2. User Input and Processing
The heart of the project is a programming language (initially implemented in Python but open to consideration for alternative languages) that enables user interaction. Upon user input of the absent teacher's name, the program retrieves the entire schedule for that teacher from the JSON database.

### 3. Generating Substitute Teacher Recommendations
Once the absent teacher's schedule is retrieved, the program intelligently analyzes the data to identify suitable substitute teachers for each class throughout the day. It ensures that there are multiple substitute teachers listed, as one individual cannot be available for all classes during the day.

## Features and Benefits
The Schedule Savior project offers several features and benefits, making it a valuable addition to any educational institution:

- **Efficiency**: Schools can quickly and efficiently find substitute teachers to cover for absent staff, minimizing disruptions to the learning process.

- **Flexibility**: The project accommodates multiple teachers' schedules, ensuring that there are options available for every class throughout the day.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The program offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for inputting the absent teacher's name and receiving a list of recommended substitute teachers.

- **Scalability**: With a JSON-based data storage system, the project can easily scale to accommodate more teachers and classes as the institution grows.

- **Customization**: The codebase is designed to be easily customizable, allowing schools to adapt it to their specific needs and preferences.
